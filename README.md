# HealthSites
Kotlin Android App

Based on an integrated map to see in real time the places, both restaurants and shops, that offer vegan, vegetarian, organic, gluten-free and lactose-free services, together with other additional functionalities such as filtering the map itself.

In addition, you can leave comments on each of the profiles of the so-called HealthSites and support the most interesting ones by leaving them a like, in order to create a record of the user's experience.  In this way, any newcomer will be able to get feedback based on the opinions of others. 

Users who want to eat healthy or buy specific products will be able to locate the nearest HealthSites through the app and decide which one is the right one for them. Also, you can follow the HealthSites to have your favorites listed in the "My HealthSites" section, which serves as a gateway to view certain information, unfollow, make comments and easily access each HealthSite's profile.
